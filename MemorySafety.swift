// MARK: - Introduction to Memory Safety

// By default, Swift prevents unsafe behavior from happening in your code. For example, Swift
// ensures that variables are initialized before they're used, memory isn't accessed after it's
// been deallocated, and array indices are checked for out-of-bounds errors.

// Swift also makes sure that multiple accesses to the same area of memory don't conflict, by
// requiring code that modifies a location in memory to have exclusive access to that memory.
// Because Swift manages memory automatically, most of the time you don't have to think about
// accessing memory at all. However, it's important to understand where potential conflicts can
// occur, so you can avoid writing code that has conflicting access to memory. If your code does
// contain conflicts, you'll get a compile-time or runtime error.

// MARK: - Understanding Conflicting Access to Memory

// Access to memory happens in your code when you do things like set the value of a variable or
// pass an argument to a function. For example, the following code contains both a read access
// and a write access

// A write access to the memory where one is stored.
var one = 1

// A read access from the memory where one is stored.
print("We're number \(one)!")

// A conflicting access to memory can occur when different parts of your code are trying to access
// the same location in memory at the same time. Multiple accesses to a location in memory at the
// same time can produce unpredictable or inconsistent behavior. In Swift, there are ways to modify
// a value that span several lines of code, making it possible to attempt to access a value in the
// middle of its own modification.

// MARK: - Characteristics of Memory Access

// There are three characteristics of memory access to consider in the context of conflicting
// access: whether the access is a read or a write, the duration of the access, and the location
// in memory being accessed. Specifically, a conflict occurs if you have two accesses that meet
// all of the following conditions:
// - The accesses aren't both reads, and aren't both atomic.
// - They access the same location in memory.
// - Their durations overlap.

// The difference between a read and write access is usually obvious: a write access changes the
// location in memory, but a read access doesn't. The location in memory refers to what is being
// accessed — for example, a variable, constant, or property. The duration of a memory access is
// either instantaneous or long-term.

// An access is atomic if it's a call to an atomic operation on Atomic or AtomicLazyReference, or
// it uses only C atomic operations; otherwise it's nonatomic.

// An access is instantaneous if it's not possible for other code to run after that access starts
// but before it ends. By their nature, two instantaneous accesses can't happen at the same time.
// Most memory access is instantaneous. For example, all the read and write accesses in the code
// listing below are instantaneous

func oneMore(than number: Int) -> Int {
    return number + 1
}

var myNumber = 1
myNumber = oneMore(than: myNumber)
print(myNumber)
// Prints "2"

// However, there are several ways to access memory, called long-term accesses, that span the
// execution of other code. The difference between instantaneous access and long-term access is
// that it's possible for other code to run after a long-term access starts but before it ends,
// which is called overlap. A long-term access can overlap with other long-term accesses and
// instantaneous accesses.

// Overlapping accesses appear primarily in code that uses in-out parameters in functions and
// methods or mutating methods of a structure. The specific kinds of Swift code that use long-term
// accesses are discussed in the sections below.

// MARK: - Conflicting Access to In-Out Parameters

// A function has long-term write access to all of its in-out parameters. The write access for an
// in-out parameter starts after all of the non-in-out parameters have been evaluated and lasts for
// the entire duration of that function call. If there are multiple in-out parameters, the write
// accesses start in the same order as the parameters appear.

// One consequence of this long-term write access is that you can't access the original variable
// that was passed as in-out, even if scoping rules and access control would otherwise permit it —
// any access to the original creates a conflict. For example

var stepSize = 1

func increment(_ number: inout Int) {
    number += stepSize
}

// increment(&stepSize)
// Error: Conflicting accesses to stepSize.

// In the code above, stepSize is a global variable, and it's normally accessible from within
// increment(_:). However, the read access to stepSize overlaps with the write access to number.
// As shown in the figure below, both number and stepSize refer to the same location in memory.
// The read and write accesses refer to the same memory and they overlap, producing a conflict.

// One way to solve this conflict is to make an explicit copy of stepSize

// Make an explicit copy.
var copyOfStepSize = stepSize
increment(&copyOfStepSize)

// Update the original.
stepSize = copyOfStepSize
// stepSize is now 2

// When you make a copy of stepSize before calling increment(_:), it's clear that the value of
// copyOfStepSize is incremented by the current step size. The read access ends before the write
// access starts, so there isn't a conflict.

// Another consequence of long-term write access to in-out parameters is that passing a single
// variable as the argument for multiple in-out parameters of the same function produces a conflict.
// For example

func balance(_ x: inout Int, _ y: inout Int) {
    let sum = x + y
    x = sum / 2
    y = sum - x
}

var playerOneScore = 42
var playerTwoScore = 30
balance(&playerOneScore, &playerTwoScore)  // OK

// balance(&playerOneScore, &playerOneScore)
// Error: Conflicting accesses to playerOneScore.

// The balance(_:_:) function above modifies its two parameters to divide the total value evenly
// between them. Calling it with playerOneScore and playerTwoScore as arguments doesn't produce
// a conflict — there are two write accesses that overlap in time, but they access different
// locations in memory. In contrast, passing playerOneScore as the value for both parameters
// produces a conflict because it tries to perform two write accesses to the same location in
// memory at the same time.

// Note: Because operators are functions, they can also have long-term accesses to their in-out
// parameters. For example, if balance(_:_:) was an operator function named <^>, writing
// playerOneScore <^> playerOneScore would result in the same conflict as
// balance(&playerOneScore, &playerOneScore).

// MARK: - Conflicting Access to self in Methods

// A mutating method on a structure has write access to self for the duration of the method call.
// For example, consider a game where each player has a health amount, which decreases when taking
// damage, and an energy amount, which decreases when using special abilities

struct Player {
    var name: String
    var health: Int
    var energy: Int
    
    static let maxHealth = 10
    mutating func restoreHealth() {
        health = Player.maxHealth
    }
}

// In the restoreHealth() method above, a write access to self starts at the beginning of the
// method and lasts until the method returns. In this case, there's no other code inside
// restoreHealth() that could have an overlapping access to the properties of a Player instance.
// The shareHealth(with:) method below takes another Player instance as an in-out parameter,
// creating the possibility of overlapping accesses

extension Player {
    mutating func shareHealth(with teammate: inout Player) {
        balance(&teammate.health, &health)
    }
}

var oscar = Player(name: "Oscar", health: 10, energy: 10)
var maria = Player(name: "Maria", health: 5, energy: 10)
oscar.shareHealth(with: &maria)  // OK

// In the example above, calling the shareHealth(with:) method for Oscar's player to share health
// with Maria's player doesn't cause a conflict. There's a write access to oscar during the method
// call because oscar is the value of self in a mutating method, and there's a write access to
// maria for the same duration because maria was passed as an in-out parameter. As shown in the
// figure below, they access different locations in memory. Even though the two write accesses
// overlap in time, they don't conflict.

// However, if you pass oscar as the argument to shareHealth(with:), there's a conflict

// oscar.shareHealth(with: &oscar)
// Error: Conflicting accesses to oscar.

// The mutating method needs write access to self for the duration of the method, and the in-out
// parameter needs write access to teammate for the same duration. Within the method, both
// self and teammate refer to the same location in memory — as shown in the figure below. The two
// write accesses refer to the same memory and they overlap, producing a conflict.

// MARK: - Conflicting Access to Properties

// Types like structures, tuples, and enumerations are made up of individual constituent values,
// such as the properties of a structure or the elements of a tuple. Because these are value types,
// mutating any piece of the value mutates the whole value, meaning read or write access to one of
// the properties requires read or write access to the whole value. For example, overlapping write
// accesses to the elements of a tuple produces a conflict

var playerInformation = (health: 10, energy: 20)
// balance(&playerInformation.health, &playerInformation.energy)
// Error: Conflicting access to properties of playerInformation.

// In the example above, calling balance(_:_:) on the elements of a tuple produces a conflict
// because there are overlapping write accesses to playerInformation. Both playerInformation.health
// and playerInformation.energy are passed as in-out parameters, which means balance(_:_:) needs
// write access to them for the duration of the function call. In both cases, a write access to
// the tuple element requires a write access to the entire tuple. This means there are two write
// accesses to playerInformation with durations that overlap, causing a conflict.

// The code below shows that the same error appears for overlapping write accesses to the properties
// of a structure that's stored in a global variable

var holly = Player(name: "Holly", health: 10, energy: 10)
// balance(&holly.health, &holly.energy)  // Error

// In practice, most access to the properties of a structure can overlap safely. For example, if
// the variable holly in the example above is changed to a local variable instead of a global
// variable, the compiler can prove that overlapping access to stored properties of the structure
// is safe

func someFunction() {
    var oscar = Player(name: "Oscar", health: 10, energy: 10)
    balance(&oscar.health, &oscar.energy)  // OK
}

// In the example above, Oscar's health and energy are passed as the two in-out parameters to
// balance(_:_:). The compiler can prove that memory safety is preserved because the two stored
// properties don't interact in any way.

// The restriction against overlapping access to properties of a structure isn't always necessary
// to preserve memory safety. Memory safety is the desired guarantee, but exclusive access is a
// stricter requirement than memory safety — which means some code preserves memory safety, even
// though it violates exclusive access to memory. Swift allows this memory-safe code if the
// compiler can prove that the nonexclusive access to memory is still safe. Specifically, it can
// prove that overlapping access to properties of a structure is safe if the following conditions
// apply:
// - You're accessing only stored properties of an instance, not computed properties or class
//   properties.
// - The structure is the value of a local variable, not a global variable.
// - The structure is either not captured by any closures, or it's captured only by nonescaping
//   closures.

// If the compiler can't prove the access is safe, it doesn't allow the access.
