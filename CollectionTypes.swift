//  Arrays, Sets, and Dictionaries for storing collections of values.
//

import Foundation

// MARK: - Introduction to Collection Types

// Swift provides three primary collection types, known as arrays, sets, and dictionaries,
// for storing collections of values:
// - Arrays are ordered collections of values
// - Sets are unordered collections of unique values
// - Dictionaries are unordered collections of key-value associations

// Arrays, sets, and dictionaries in Swift are always clear about the types of values and keys
// that they can store. This means that you can't insert a value of the wrong type into a
// collection by mistake. It also means you can be confident about the type of values you
// will retrieve from a collection.

// Note: Swift's array, set, and dictionary types are implemented as generic collections.

// MARK: - Mutability of Collections

// If you create an array, a set, or a dictionary, and assign it to a variable, the collection
// that's created will be mutable. This means that you can change (or mutate) the collection
// after it's created by adding, removing, or changing items in the collection. If you assign
// an array, a set, or a dictionary to a constant, that collection is immutable, and its size
// and contents can't be changed.

var mutableArray = [1, 2, 3]
mutableArray.append(4)  // Allowed - mutable

let immutableArray = [1, 2, 3]
// immutableArray.append(4)  // Error - immutable

// Note: It's good practice to create immutable collections in all cases where the collection
// doesn't need to change. Doing so makes it easier for you to reason about your code and
// enables the Swift compiler to optimize the performance of the collections you create.

// MARK: - Arrays

// An array stores values of the same type in an ordered list. The same value can appear in
// an array multiple times at different positions.

// Note: Swift's Array type is bridged to Foundation's NSArray class.

// MARK: - Array Type Shorthand Syntax

// The type of a Swift array is written in full as Array<Element>, where Element is the type
// of values the array is allowed to store. You can also write the type of an array in shorthand
// form as [Element]. Although the two forms are functionally identical, the shorthand form is
// preferred and is used throughout this guide when referring to the type of an array.

let fullForm: Array<Int> = [1, 2, 3]
let shorthandForm: [Int] = [1, 2, 3]
// Both are equivalent

// MARK: - Creating an Empty Array

// You can create an empty array in Swift using two approaches. If the context already provides
// type information, such as a function argument or an already typed variable or constant, you
// can use an empty array literal, which is written as [] (an empty pair of square brackets)

var someInts: [Int] = []
print("someInts is of type [Int] with \(someInts.count) items.")
// Prints "someInts is of type [Int] with 0 items."

// Alternatively, you can create an empty array of a certain type using explicit initializer syntax,
// by writing the element type in square brackets followed by parentheses

var someInts2 = [Int]()
print("someInts2 is of type [Int] with \(someInts2.count) items.")
// Prints "someInts2 is of type [Int] with 0 items."

// Both approaches produce the same result. However, an empty array literal is shorter and usually easier to read.

// In both cases, you can use the empty array literal ([]) to reassign an empty array to an existing variable

someInts.append(3)
// someInts now contains 1 value of type Int
someInts = []
// someInts is now an empty array, but is still of type [Int]

// MARK: - Creating an Array with a Default Value

// Swift's Array type also provides an initializer for creating an array of a certain size with all
// of its values set to the same default value. You pass this initializer a default value of the
// appropriate type (called repeating): and the number of times that value is repeated in the new
// array (called count)

var threeDoubles = Array(repeating: 0.0, count: 3)
// threeDoubles is of type [Double], and equals [0.0, 0.0, 0.0]
print("Array with default value: \(threeDoubles)")

// MARK: - Creating an Array by Adding Two Arrays Together

// You can create a new array by adding together two existing arrays with compatible types with
// the addition operator (+). The new array's type is inferred from the type of the two arrays
// you add together

var anotherThreeDoubles = Array(repeating: 2.5, count: 3)
// anotherThreeDoubles is of type [Double], and equals [2.5, 2.5, 2.5]

var sixDoubles = threeDoubles + anotherThreeDoubles
// sixDoubles is inferred as [Double], and equals [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 2.5, 2.5, 2.5]
print("Combined arrays: \(sixDoubles)")

// MARK: - Creating an Array with an Array Literal

// You can also initialize an array with an array literal, which is a shorthand way to write one
// or more values as an array collection. An array literal is written as a list of values,
// separated by commas, surrounded by a pair of square brackets

var shoppingList: [String] = ["Eggs", "Milk"]
// shoppingList has been initialized with two initial items
print("Shopping list: \(shoppingList)")

// The shoppingList variable is declared as "an array of string values", written as [String].
// Because this particular array has specified a value type of String, it's allowed to store
// String values only. Here, the shoppingList array is initialized with two String values
// ("Eggs" and "Milk"), written within an array literal.

// Note: The shoppingList array is declared as a variable (with the var introducer) and not a
// constant (with the let introducer) because more items are added to the shopping list in the
// examples below.

// Thanks to Swift's type inference, you don't have to write the type of the array if you're
// initializing it with an array literal containing values of the same type

var shoppingList2 = ["Eggs", "Milk"]
// Swift infers [String] as the type

// MARK: - Accessing and Modifying an Array

// You access and modify an array through its methods and properties, or by using subscript syntax.

// To find out the number of items in an array, check its read-only count property

print("The shopping list contains \(shoppingList.count) items.")
// Prints "The shopping list contains 2 items."

// Use the Boolean isEmpty property as a shortcut for checking whether the count property is equal to 0

if shoppingList.isEmpty {
    print("The shopping list is empty.")
} else {
    print("The shopping list isn't empty.")
}
// Prints "The shopping list isn't empty."

// You can add a new item to the end of an array by calling the array's append(_:) method

shoppingList.append("Flour")
// shoppingList now contains 3 items, and someone is making pancakes
print("After appending 'Flour': \(shoppingList)")

// Alternatively, append an array of one or more compatible items with the addition assignment operator (+=)

shoppingList += ["Baking Powder"]
// shoppingList now contains 4 items
print("After += ['Baking Powder']: \(shoppingList)")

shoppingList += ["Chocolate Spread", "Cheese", "Butter"]
// shoppingList now contains 7 items
print("After += multiple items: \(shoppingList)")

// Retrieve a value from the array by using subscript syntax, passing the index of the value
// you want to retrieve within square brackets immediately after the name of the array

var firstItem = shoppingList[0]
// firstItem is equal to "Eggs"
print("First item: \(firstItem)")

// Note: The first item in the array has an index of 0, not 1. Arrays in Swift are always zero-indexed.

// You can use subscript syntax to change an existing value at a given index

shoppingList[0] = "Six eggs"
// the first item in the list is now equal to "Six eggs" rather than "Eggs"
print("After changing first item: \(shoppingList)")

// When you use subscript syntax, the index you specify needs to be valid. For example, writing
// shoppingList[shoppingList.count] = "Salt" to try to append an item to the end of the array
// results in a runtime error.

// You can also use subscript syntax to change a range of values at once, even if the replacement
// set of values has a different length than the range you are replacing

shoppingList[4...6] = ["Bananas", "Apples"]
// shoppingList now contains 6 items
print("After replacing range: \(shoppingList)")

// To insert an item into the array at a specified index, call the array's insert(_:at:) method

shoppingList.insert("Maple Syrup", at: 0)
// shoppingList now contains 7 items
// "Maple Syrup" is now the first item in the list
print("After inserting at index 0: \(shoppingList)")

// Similarly, you remove an item from the array with the remove(at:) method. This method removes
// the item at the specified index and returns the removed item (although you can ignore the
// returned value if you don't need it)

let mapleSyrup = shoppingList.remove(at: 0)
// the item that was at index 0 has just been removed
// shoppingList now contains 6 items, and no Maple Syrup
// the mapleSyrup constant is now equal to the removed "Maple Syrup" string
print("Removed item: \(mapleSyrup)")
print("After removal: \(shoppingList)")

// Note: If you try to access or modify a value for an index that's outside of an array's existing
// bounds, you will trigger a runtime error. You can check that an index is valid before using it
// by comparing it to the array's count property. The largest valid index in an array is count - 1
// because arrays are indexed from zero — however, when count is 0 (meaning the array is empty),
// there are no valid indexes.

// Any gaps in an array are closed when an item is removed, and so the value at index 0 is once
// again equal to "Six eggs"

firstItem = shoppingList[0]
// firstItem is now equal to "Six eggs"
print("First item after removal: \(firstItem)")

// If you want to remove the final item from an array, use the removeLast() method rather than
// the remove(at:) method to avoid the need to query the array's count property. Like the remove(at:)
// method, removeLast() returns the removed item

let apples = shoppingList.removeLast()
// the last item in the array has just been removed
// shoppingList now contains 5 items, and no apples
// the apples constant is now equal to the removed "Apples" string
print("Removed last item: \(apples)")
print("After removing last: \(shoppingList)")

// MARK: - Iterating Over an Array

// You can iterate over the entire set of values in an array with the for-in loop

print("Iterating over shopping list:")
for item in shoppingList {
    print("  \(item)")
}
// Six eggs
// Milk
// Flour
// Baking Powder
// Bananas

// If you need the integer index of each item as well as its value, use the enumerated() method
// to iterate over the array instead. For each item in the array, the enumerated() method returns
// a tuple composed of an integer and the item. The integers start at zero and count up by one for
// each item; if you enumerate over a whole array, these integers match the items' indices

print("Iterating with indices:")
for (index, value) in shoppingList.enumerated() {
    print("  Item \(index + 1): \(value)")
}
// Item 1: Six eggs
// Item 2: Milk
// Item 3: Flour
// Item 4: Baking Powder
// Item 5: Bananas

// MARK: - Sets

// A set stores distinct values of the same type in a collection with no defined ordering.
// You can use a set instead of an array when the order of items isn't important, or when you
// need to ensure that an item only appears once.

// Note: Swift's Set type is bridged to Foundation's NSSet class.

// MARK: - Hash Values for Set Types

// A type must be hashable in order to be stored in a set — that is, the type must provide a way
// to compute a hash value for itself. A hash value is an Int value that's the same for all objects
// that compare equally, such that if a == b, the hash value of a is equal to the hash value of b.

// All of Swift's basic types (such as String, Int, Double, and Bool) are hashable by default,
// and can be used as set value types or dictionary key types. Enumeration case values without
// associated values (as described in Enumerations) are also hashable by default.

// Note: You can use your own custom types as set value types or dictionary key types by making
// them conform to the Hashable protocol from the Swift standard library.

// MARK: - Set Type Syntax

// The type of a Swift set is written as Set<Element>, where Element is the type that the set
// is allowed to store. Unlike arrays, sets don't have an equivalent shorthand form.

// MARK: - Creating and Initializing an Empty Set

// You can create an empty set of a certain type using initializer syntax

var letters = Set<Character>()
print("letters is of type Set<Character> with \(letters.count) items.")
// Prints "letters is of type Set<Character> with 0 items."

// Note: The type of the letters variable is inferred to be Set<Character>, from the type of the initializer.

// Alternatively, if the context already provides type information, such as a function argument or
// an already typed variable or constant, you can create an empty set with an empty array literal

letters.insert("a")
// letters now contains 1 value of type Character
print("After inserting 'a': \(letters)")

letters = []
// letters is now an empty set, but is still of type Set<Character>
print("After reassigning to []: \(letters)")

// MARK: - Creating a Set with an Array Literal

// You can also initialize a set with an array literal, as a shorthand way to write one or more
// values as a set collection.

// The example below creates a set called favoriteGenres to store String values

var favoriteGenres: Set<String> = ["Rock", "Classical", "Hip hop"]
// favoriteGenres has been initialized with three initial items
print("Favorite genres: \(favoriteGenres)")

// The favoriteGenres variable is declared as "a set of String values", written as Set<String>.
// Because this particular set has specified a value type of String, it's only allowed to store
// String values. Here, the favoriteGenres set is initialized with three String values
// ("Rock", "Classical", and "Hip hop"), written within an array literal.

// Note: The favoriteGenres set is declared as a variable (with the var introducer) and not a
// constant (with the let introducer) because items are added and removed in the examples below.

// A set type can't be inferred from an array literal alone, so the type Set must be explicitly declared.
// However, because of Swift's type inference, you don't have to write the type of the set's elements
// if you're initializing it with an array literal that contains values of just one type

var favoriteGenres2: Set = ["Rock", "Classical", "Hip hop"]
// Swift infers Set<String> as the type

// MARK: - Accessing and Modifying a Set

// You access and modify a set through its methods and properties.

// To find out the number of items in a set, check its read-only count property

print("I have \(favoriteGenres.count) favorite music genres.")
// Prints "I have 3 favorite music genres."

// Use the Boolean isEmpty property as a shortcut for checking whether the count property is equal to 0

if favoriteGenres.isEmpty {
    print("As far as music goes, I'm not picky.")
} else {
    print("I have particular music preferences.")
}
// Prints "I have particular music preferences."

// You can add a new item into a set by calling the set's insert(_:) method

favoriteGenres.insert("Jazz")
// favoriteGenres now contains 4 items
print("After inserting 'Jazz': \(favoriteGenres)")

// You can remove an item from a set by calling the set's remove(_:) method, which removes the item
// if it's a member of the set, and returns the removed value, or returns nil if the set didn't contain it.
// Alternatively, all items in a set can be removed with its removeAll() method

if let removedGenre = favoriteGenres.remove("Rock") {
    print("\(removedGenre)? I'm over it.")
} else {
    print("I never much cared for that.")
}
// Prints "Rock? I'm over it."

// To check whether a set contains a particular item, use the contains(_:) method

if favoriteGenres.contains("Funk") {
    print("I get up on the good foot.")
} else {
    print("It's too funky in here.")
}
// Prints "It's too funky in here."

// MARK: - Iterating Over a Set

// You can iterate over the values in a set with a for-in loop

print("Iterating over favorite genres:")
for genre in favoriteGenres {
    print("  \(genre)")
}
// Classical
// Jazz
// Hip hop

// Swift's Set type doesn't have a defined ordering. To iterate over the values of a set in a specific
// order, use the sorted() method, which returns the set's elements as an array sorted using the < operator

print("Iterating over sorted favorite genres:")
for genre in favoriteGenres.sorted() {
    print("  \(genre)")
}
// Classical
// Hip hop
// Jazz

// MARK: - Performing Set Operations

// You can efficiently perform fundamental set operations, such as combining two sets together,
// determining which values two sets have in common, or determining whether two sets contain all,
// some, or none of the same values.

// MARK: - Fundamental Set Operations

// Use the intersection(_:) method to create a new set with only the values common to both sets.
// Use the symmetricDifference(_:) method to create a new set with values in either set, but not both.
// Use the union(_:) method to create a new set with all of the values in both sets.
// Use the subtracting(_:) method to create a new set with values not in the specified set.

let oddDigits: Set = [1, 3, 5, 7, 9]
let evenDigits: Set = [0, 2, 4, 6, 8]
let singleDigitPrimeNumbers: Set = [2, 3, 5, 7]

print("Set operations:")

print("  singleDigitPrimeNumbers: \(singleDigitPrimeNumbers)")

let unionResult = oddDigits.union(evenDigits).sorted()
print("  Union: \(unionResult)")
// [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]

let intersectionResult = oddDigits.intersection(evenDigits).sorted()
print("  Intersection: \(intersectionResult)")
// []

let subtractingResult = oddDigits.subtracting(singleDigitPrimeNumbers).sorted()

// [1, 9]

let symmetricDifferenceResult = oddDigits.symmetricDifference(singleDigitPrimeNumbers).sorted()
print("  Symmetric difference: \(symmetricDifferenceResult)")
// [1, 2, 9]

// MARK: - Set Membership and Equality

// Use the "is equal" operator (==) to determine whether two sets contain all of the same values.
// Use the isSubset(of:) method to determine whether all of the values of a set are contained in the specified set.
// Use the isSuperset(of:) method to determine whether a set contains all of the values in a specified set.
// Use the isStrictSubset(of:) or isStrictSuperset(of:) methods to determine whether a set is a subset
// or superset, but not equal to, a specified set.
// Use the isDisjoint(with:) method to determine whether two sets have no values in common.

let houseAnimals: Set = ["🐶", "🐱"]
let farmAnimals: Set = ["🐮", "🐔", "🐑", "🐶", "🐱"]
let cityAnimals: Set = ["🐦", "🐭"]

print("Set membership:")
print("  houseAnimals: \(houseAnimals)")

// true

print("  farmAnimals.isDisjoint(with: cityAnimals): \(farmAnimals.isDisjoint(with: cityAnimals))")
// true

// MARK: - Dictionaries

// A dictionary stores associations between keys of the same type and values of the same type in a
// collection with no defined ordering. Each value is associated with a unique key, which acts as an
// identifier for that value within the dictionary. Unlike items in an array, items in a dictionary
// don't have a specified order. You use a dictionary when you need to look up values based on their
// identifier, in much the same way that a real-world dictionary is used to look up the definition
// for a particular word.

// Note: Swift's Dictionary type is bridged to Foundation's NSDictionary class.

// MARK: - Dictionary Type Shorthand Syntax

// The type of a Swift dictionary is written in full as Dictionary<Key, Value>, where Key is the type
// of value that can be used as a dictionary key, and Value is the type of value that the dictionary
// stores for those keys.

// Note: A dictionary Key type must conform to the Hashable protocol, like a set's value type.

// You can also write the type of a dictionary in shorthand form as [Key: Value]. Although the two forms
// are functionally identical, the shorthand form is preferred and is used throughout this guide when
// referring to the type of a dictionary.

let fullFormDict: Dictionary<String, Int> = ["one": 1, "two": 2]
let shorthandFormDict: [String: Int] = ["one": 1, "two": 2]
// Both are equivalent

// MARK: - Creating an Empty Dictionary

// As with arrays, you can create an empty Dictionary of a certain type by using initializer syntax

var namesOfIntegers: [Int: String] = [:]
// namesOfIntegers is an empty [Int: String] dictionary
print("Empty dictionary: \(namesOfIntegers)")

// This example creates an empty dictionary of type [Int: String] to store human-readable names of
// integer values. Its keys are of type Int, and its values are of type String.

// If the context already provides type information, you can create an empty dictionary with an empty
// dictionary literal, which is written as [:] (a colon inside a pair of square brackets)

namesOfIntegers[16] = "sixteen"
// namesOfIntegers now contains 1 key-value pair
print("After adding key-value pair: \(namesOfIntegers)")

namesOfIntegers = [:]
// namesOfIntegers is once again an empty dictionary of type [Int: String]
print("After reassigning to [:]: \(namesOfIntegers)")

// MARK: - Creating a Dictionary with a Dictionary Literal

// You can also initialize a dictionary with a dictionary literal, which has a similar syntax to the
// array literal seen earlier. A dictionary literal is a shorthand way to write one or more key-value
// pairs as a Dictionary collection.

// A key-value pair is a combination of a key and a value. In a dictionary literal, the key and value
// in each key-value pair are separated by a colon. The key-value pairs are written as a list,
// separated by commas, surrounded by a pair of square brackets

// The example below creates a dictionary to store the names of international airports. In this dictionary,
// the keys are three-letter International Air Transport Association codes, and the values are airport names

var airports: [String: String] = ["YYZ": "Toronto Pearson", "DUB": "Dublin"]
print("Airports dictionary: \(airports)")

// The airports dictionary is declared as having a type of [String: String], which means "a Dictionary
// whose keys are of type String, and whose values are also of type String".

// Note: The airports dictionary is declared as a variable (with the var introducer), and not a constant
// (with the let introducer), because more airports are added to the dictionary in the examples below.

// The airports dictionary is initialized with a dictionary literal containing two key-value pairs.
// The first pair has a key of "YYZ" and a value of "Toronto Pearson". The second pair has a key of
// "DUB" and a value of "Dublin".

// As with arrays, you don't have to write the type of the dictionary if you're initializing it with
// a dictionary literal whose keys and values have consistent types

var airports2 = ["YYZ": "Toronto Pearson", "DUB": "Dublin"]
// Swift infers [String: String] as the type

// MARK: - Accessing and Modifying a Dictionary

// You access and modify a dictionary through its methods and properties, or by using subscript syntax.

// As with an array, you find out the number of items in a Dictionary by checking its read-only count property

print("The airports dictionary contains \(airports.count) items.")
// Prints "The airports dictionary contains 2 items."

// Use the Boolean isEmpty property as a shortcut for checking whether the count property is equal to 0

if airports.isEmpty {
    print("The airports dictionary is empty.")
} else {
    print("The airports dictionary isn't empty.")

// You can add a new item to a dictionary with subscript syntax. Use a new key of the appropriate type
// as the subscript index, and assign a new value of the appropriate type

airports["LHR"] = "London"
// the airports dictionary now contains 3 items
print("After adding LHR: \(airports)")

// You can also use subscript syntax to change the value associated with a particular key

airports["LHR"] = "London Heathrow"
// the value for "LHR" has been changed to "London Heathrow"

// As an alternative to subscripting, use a dictionary's updateValue(_:forKey:) method to set or update
// the value for a particular key. Like the subscript examples above, the updateValue(_:forKey:) method
// sets a value for a key if none exists, or updates the value if that key already exists. Unlike a
// subscript, however, the updateValue(_:forKey:) method returns the old value after performing an update.
// This enables you to check whether or not an update took place.

// The updateValue(_:forKey:) method returns an optional value of the dictionary's value type. For a
// dictionary that stores String values, for example, the method returns a value of type String?,
// or "optional String". This optional value contains the old value for that key if one existed before
// the update, or nil if no value existed

if let oldValue = airports.updateValue("Dublin Airport", forKey: "DUB") {
    print("The old value for DUB was \(oldValue).")
}
// Prints "The old value for DUB was Dublin."
print("After updating DUB: \(airports)")

// You can also use subscript syntax to retrieve a value from the dictionary for a particular key.
// Because it's possible to request a key for which no value exists, a dictionary's subscript returns
// an optional value of the dictionary's value type. If the dictionary contains a value for the requested
// key, the subscript returns an optional value containing the existing value for that key. Otherwise,
