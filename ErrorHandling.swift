// MARK: - Introduction to Error Handling

// Error handling is the process of responding to and recovering from error conditions
// in your program. Swift provides first-class support for throwing, catching, propagating,
// and manipulating recoverable errors at runtime.

// Some operations aren't guaranteed to always complete execution or produce a useful output.
// Optionals are used to represent the absence of a value, but when an operation fails, it's
// often useful to understand what caused the failure, so that your code can respond accordingly.

// As an example, consider the task of reading and processing data from a file on disk. There
// are a number of ways this task can fail, including the file not existing at the specified
// path, the file not having read permissions, or the file not being encoded in a compatible
// format. Distinguishing among these different situations allows a program to resolve some
// errors and to communicate to the user any errors it can't resolve.

// Note: Error handling in Swift interoperates with error handling patterns that use the
// NSError class in Cocoa and Objective-C.

// MARK: - Representing and Throwing Errors

// In Swift, errors are represented by values of types that conform to the Error protocol.
// This empty protocol indicates that a type can be used for error handling.

// Swift enumerations are particularly well suited to modeling a group of related error
// conditions, with associated values allowing for additional information about the nature
// of an error to be communicated. For example, here's how you might represent the error
// conditions of operating a vending machine inside a game

enum VendingMachineError: Error {
    case invalidSelection
    case insufficientFunds(coinsNeeded: Int)
    case outOfStock
}

// Throwing an error lets you indicate that something unexpected happened and the normal flow
// of execution can't continue. You use a throw statement to throw an error. For example, the
// following code throws an error to indicate that five additional coins are needed by the
// vending machine

// throw VendingMachineError.insufficientFunds(coinsNeeded: 5)

// MARK: - Handling Errors

// When an error is thrown, some surrounding piece of code must be responsible for handling
// the error — for example, by correcting the problem, trying an alternative approach, or
// informing the user of the failure.

// There are four ways to handle errors in Swift. You can propagate the error from a function
// to the code that calls that function, handle the error using a do-catch statement, handle
// the error as an optional value, or assert that the error will not occur. Each approach
// is described in a section below.

// When a function throws an error, it changes the flow of your program, so it's important
// that you can quickly identify places in your code that can throw errors. To identify these
// places in your code, write the try keyword — or the try? or try! variation — before a
// piece of code that calls a function, method, or initializer that can throw an error.

// Note: Error handling in Swift resembles exception handling in other languages, with the
// use of the try, catch and throw keywords. Unlike exception handling in many languages —
// including Objective-C — error handling in Swift doesn't involve unwinding the call stack,
// a process that can be computationally expensive. As such, the performance characteristics
// of a throw statement are comparable to those of a return statement.

// MARK: - Propagating Errors Using Throwing Functions

// To indicate that a function, method, or initializer can throw an error, you write the
// throws keyword in the function's declaration after its parameters. A function marked with
// throws is called a throwing function. If the function specifies a return type, you write
// the throws keyword before the return arrow (->).

// func canThrowErrors() throws -> String
// func cannotThrowErrors() -> String

// A throwing function propagates errors that are thrown inside of it to the scope from which
// it's called.

// Note: Only throwing functions can propagate errors. Any errors thrown inside a nonthrowing
// function must be handled inside the function.

// In the example below, the VendingMachine class has a vend(itemNamed:) method that throws
// an appropriate VendingMachineError if the requested item isn't available, is out of stock,
// or has a cost that exceeds the current deposited amount

struct Item {
    var price: Int
    var count: Int
}

class VendingMachine {
    var inventory = [
        "Candy Bar": Item(price: 12, count: 7),
        "Chips": Item(price: 10, count: 4),
        "Pretzels": Item(price: 7, count: 11)
    ]
    var coinsDeposited = 0

    func vend(itemNamed name: String) throws {
        guard let item = inventory[name] else {
            throw VendingMachineError.invalidSelection
        }

        guard item.count > 0 else {
            throw VendingMachineError.outOfStock
        }

        guard item.price <= coinsDeposited else {
            throw VendingMachineError.insufficientFunds(coinsNeeded: item.price - coinsDeposited)
        }

        coinsDeposited -= item.price

        var newItem = item
        newItem.count -= 1
        inventory[name] = newItem

        print("Dispensing \(name)")
    }
}

// The implementation of the vend(itemNamed:) method uses guard statements to exit the method
// early and throw appropriate errors if any of the requirements for purchasing a snack aren't
// met. Because a throw statement immediately transfers program control, an item will be vended
// only if all of these requirements are met.

// Because the vend(itemNamed:) method propagates any errors it throws, any code that calls
// this method must either handle the errors — using a do-catch statement, try?, or try! —
// or continue to propagate them. For example, the buyFavoriteSnack(person:vendingMachine:)
// in the example below is also a throwing function, and any errors that the vend(itemNamed:)
// method throws will propagate up to the point where the buyFavoriteSnack(person:vendingMachine:)
// function is called

let favoriteSnacks = [
    "Alice": "Chips",
    "Bob": "Licorice",
    "Eve": "Pretzels",
]

func buyFavoriteSnack(person: String, vendingMachine: VendingMachine) throws {
    let snackName = favoriteSnacks[person] ?? "Candy Bar"
    try vendingMachine.vend(itemNamed: snackName)
}

// In this example, the buyFavoriteSnack(person: vendingMachine:) function looks up a given
// person's favorite snack and tries to buy it for them by calling the vend(itemNamed:) method.
// Because the vend(itemNamed:) method can throw an error, it's called with the try keyword in
// front of it.

// Throwing initializers can propagate errors in the same way as throwing functions. For example,
// the initializer for the PurchasedSnack structure in the listing below calls a throwing
// function as part of the initialization process, and it handles any errors that it encounters
// by propagating them to its caller

struct PurchasedSnack {
    let name: String
    init(name: String, vendingMachine: VendingMachine) throws {
        try vendingMachine.vend(itemNamed: name)
        self.name = name
    }
}

// MARK: - Handling Errors Using Do-Catch

// You use a do-catch statement to handle errors by running a block of code. If an error is
// thrown by the code in the do clause, it's matched against the catch clauses to determine
// which one of them can handle the error.

// Here is the general form of a do-catch statement:
// do {
//     try <#expression#>
//     <#statements#>
// } catch <#pattern 1#> {
//     <#statements#>
// } catch <#pattern 2#> where <#condition#> {
//     <#statements#>
// } catch <#pattern 3#>, <#pattern 4#> where <#condition#> {
//     <#statements#>
// } catch {
//     <#statements#>
// }

// You write a pattern after catch to indicate what errors that clause can handle. If a catch
// clause doesn't have a pattern, the clause matches any error and binds the error to a local
// constant named error. For more information about pattern matching, see Patterns.

// For example, the following code matches against all three cases of the VendingMachineError
// enumeration

var vendingMachine = VendingMachine()
vendingMachine.coinsDeposited = 8

do {
    try buyFavoriteSnack(person: "Alice", vendingMachine: vendingMachine)
    print("Success! Yum.")
} catch VendingMachineError.invalidSelection {
    print("Invalid Selection.")
} catch VendingMachineError.outOfStock {
    print("Out of Stock.")
} catch VendingMachineError.insufficientFunds(let coinsNeeded) {
    print("Insufficient funds. Please insert an additional \(coinsNeeded) coins.")
} catch {
    print("Unexpected error: \(error).")
}
// Prints "Insufficient funds. Please insert an additional 2 coins."

// In the above example, the buyFavoriteSnack(person:vendingMachine:) function is called in a
// try expression, because it can throw an error. If an error is thrown, execution immediately
// transfers to the catch clauses, which decide whether to allow propagation to continue. If
// no pattern is matched, the error gets caught by the final catch clause and is bound to a
// local error constant. If no error is thrown, the remaining statements in the do statement
// are executed.

// The catch clauses don't have to handle every possible error that the code in the do clause
// can throw. If none of the catch clauses handle the error, the error propagates to the
// surrounding scope. However, the propagated error must be handled by some surrounding scope.
// In a nonthrowing function, an enclosing do-catch statement must handle the error. In a
// throwing function, either an enclosing do-catch statement or the caller must handle the
// error. If the error propagates to the top-level scope without being handled, you'll get
// a runtime error.

// For example, the above example can be written so any error that isn't a VendingMachineError
// is instead caught by the calling function

func nourish(with item: String) throws {
    do {
        try vendingMachine.vend(itemNamed: item)
    } catch is VendingMachineError {
        print("Couldn't buy that from the vending machine.")
    }
}

do {
    try nourish(with: "Beet-Flavored Chips")
} catch {
    print("Unexpected non-vending-machine-related error: \(error)")
}
// Prints "Couldn't buy that from the vending machine."

// In the nourish(with:) function, if vend(itemNamed:) throws an error that's one of the cases
// of the VendingMachineError enumeration, nourish(with:) handles the error by printing a message.
// Otherwise, nourish(with:) propagates the error to its call site. The error is then caught
// by the general catch clause.

// Another way to catch several related errors is to list them after catch, separated by commas

func eat(item: String) throws {
    do {
        try vendingMachine.vend(itemNamed: item)
    } catch VendingMachineError.invalidSelection, VendingMachineError.insufficientFunds, VendingMachineError.outOfStock {
        print("Invalid selection, out of stock, or not enough money.")
    }
}

// The eat(item:) function lists the vending machine errors to catch, and its error text
// corresponds to the items in that list. If any of the three listed errors are thrown, this
// catch clause handles them by printing a message. Any other errors are propagated to the
// surrounding scope, including any vending-machine errors that might be added later.

// MARK: - Converting Errors to Optional Values

// You use try? to handle an error by converting it to an optional value. If an error is thrown
// while evaluating the try? expression, the value of the expression is nil. For example, in the
// following code x and y have the same value and behavior

func someThrowingFunction() throws -> Int {
    // Simulate some operation that might throw
    return 42
}

let x = try? someThrowingFunction()

let y: Int?
do {
    y = try someThrowingFunction()
} catch {
    y = nil
}

// If someThrowingFunction() throws an error, the value of x and y is nil. Otherwise, the value
// of x and y is the value that the function returned. Note that x and y are an optional of
// whatever type someThrowingFunction() returns. Here the function returns an integer, so x and
// y are optional integers.

// Using try? lets you write concise error handling code when you want to handle all errors in
// the same way. For example, the following code uses several approaches to fetch data, or
// returns nil if all of the approaches fail

func fetchDataFromDisk() throws -> String {
    return "Data from disk"
}

func fetchDataFromServer() throws -> String {
    return "Data from server"
}

func fetchData() -> String? {
    if let data = try? fetchDataFromDisk() { return data }
    if let data = try? fetchDataFromServer() { return data }
    return nil
}

// MARK: - Disabling Error Propagation

// Sometimes you know a throwing function or method won't, in fact, throw an error at runtime.
// On those occasions, you can write try! before the expression to disable error propagation and
// wrap the call in a runtime assertion that no error will be thrown. If an error actually is
// thrown, you'll get a runtime error.

// For example, the following code uses a loadImage(atPath:) function, which loads the image
// resource at a given path or throws an error if the image can't be loaded. In this case,
// because the image is shipped with the application, no error will be thrown at runtime, so
// it's appropriate to disable error propagation

func loadImage(atPath path: String) throws -> String {
    // Simulate loading an image
    if path.isEmpty {
        throw NSError(domain: "ImageError", code: 1, userInfo: nil)
    }
    return "Image loaded from \(path)"
}

// let photo = try! loadImage(atPath: "./Resources/John Appleseed.jpg")
// This would work if the path is valid, but would crash if it's not

// MARK: - Specifying the Error Type

// All of the examples above use the most common kind of error handling, where the errors that
// your code throws can be values of any type that conforms to the Error protocol. This approach
// matches the reality that you don't know ahead of time every error that could happen while the
// code is running, especially when propagating errors thrown somewhere else.

// However, you might limit code to throwing errors of only one specific type in special cases.
// For example, consider code that summarizes ratings and uses the following error type

enum StatisticsError: Error {
    case noRatings
    case invalidRating(Int)
}

// To specify that a function throws only StatisticsError values as its errors, you write
// throws(StatisticsError) instead of only throws when declaring the function. This syntax is
// also called typed throws because you write the error type after throws in the declaration

func summarize(_ ratings: [Int]) throws(StatisticsError) {
    guard !ratings.isEmpty else { throw .noRatings }

    var counts = [1: 0, 2: 0, 3: 0]
    for rating in ratings {
        guard rating > 0 && rating <= 3 else { throw .invalidRating(rating) }
        counts[rating]! += 1
    }

    print("*", counts[1]!, "-- **", counts[2]!, "-- ***", counts[3]!)
}

// In the code above, the summarize(_:) function summarizes a list of ratings expressed on a
// scale of 1 to 3. This function throws an instance of StatisticsError if the input isn't
// valid. Both places in the code above that throw an error omit the type of the error because
// the function's error type is already defined. You can use the short form, throw .noRatings,
// instead of writing throw StatisticsError.noRatings when throwing an error in a function like this.

// When you write a specific error type at the start of the function, Swift checks that you
// don't throw any other errors. For example, if you tried to use VendingMachineError from
// examples earlier in this chapter in the summarize(_:) function above, that code would
// produce an error at compile time.

// You can call a function that uses typed throws from within a regular throwing function

func someThrowingFunction() throws {
    let ratings = [1, 2, 3, 2, 2, 1]
    try summarize(ratings)
}

// The code above doesn't specify an error type for someThrowingFunction(), so it throws any Error.
// You could also write the error type explicitly as throws(any Error)

func anotherThrowingFunction() throws(any Error) {
    let ratings = [1, 2, 3, 2, 2, 1]
    try summarize(ratings)
}

// Just like you can write a function that never returns with a return type of Never, you can
// write a function that never throws with throws(Never)

func nonThrowingFunction() throws(Never) {
    // This function can't throw because it's impossible to create a value of type Never to throw
}

// In addition to specifying a function's error type, you can also write a specific error type
// for a do-catch statement

let ratings: [Int] = []

do throws(StatisticsError) {
    try summarize(ratings)
} catch {
    switch error {
    case .noRatings:
        print("No ratings available")
    case .invalidRating(let rating):
        print("Invalid rating: \(rating)")
    }
}
// Prints "No ratings available"

// In this code, writing do throws(StatisticsError) indicates that the do-catch statement throws
// StatisticsError values as its errors. Like other do-catch statements, the catch clause can
// either handle every possible error or propagate unhandled errors for some surrounding scope
// to handle. This code handles all of the errors, using a switch statement with one case for
// each enumeration value.

// If a function or do block throws errors of only a single type, Swift infers that this code
// is using typed throws. Using this shorter syntax, you could write the do-catch example above
// as follows

do {
    try summarize(ratings)
} catch {
    switch error {
    case .noRatings:
        print("No ratings available")
    case .invalidRating(let rating):
        print("Invalid rating: \(rating)")
    }
}
// Prints "No ratings available"

// Even though the do-catch block above doesn't specify what type of error it throws, Swift
// infers that it throws StatisticsError. You can explicitly write throws(any Error) to avoid
// letting Swift infer typed throws.

// MARK: - Specifying Cleanup Actions

// You use a defer statement to execute a set of statements just before code execution leaves
// the current block of code. This statement lets you do any necessary cleanup that should be
// performed regardless of how execution leaves the current block of code — whether it leaves
// because an error was thrown or because of a statement such as return or break. For example,
// you can use a defer statement to ensure that file descriptors are closed and manually
// allocated memory is freed.

// A defer statement defers execution until the current scope is exited. This statement consists
// of the defer keyword and the statements to be executed later. The deferred statements may not
// contain any code that would transfer control out of the statements, such as a break or a return
// statement, or by throwing an error. Deferred actions are executed in the reverse of the order
// that they're written in your source code. That is, the code in the first defer statement executes
// last, the code in the second defer statement executes second to last, and so on. The last defer
// statement in source code order executes first.

// Simulated file operations
func exists(_ filename: String) -> Bool {
    return true
}

func open(_ filename: String) -> String {
    return "file_handle_\(filename)"
}

func close(_ file: String) {
    print("Closing file: \(file)")
}

func readline(_ file: String) throws -> String? {
    return "Line of data"
}

func processFile(filename: String) throws {
    if exists(filename) {
        let file = open(filename)
        defer {
            close(file)
        }
        while let line = try readline(file) {
            // Work with the file.
            print("Processing: \(line)")
        }
        // close(file) is called here, at the end of the scope.
    }
}

// The above example uses a defer statement to ensure that the open(_:) function has a corresponding
// call to close(_:).

// You can use a defer statement even when no error handling code is involved. For more information,
// see Deferred Actions.

// MARK: - Additional Examples

// MARK: - Multiple Defer Statements

func demonstrateDefer() {
    print("Starting function")
    defer {
        print("First defer - executes last")
    }
    defer {
        print("Second defer - executes second to last")
    }
    defer {
        print("Third defer - executes first")
    }
