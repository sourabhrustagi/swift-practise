import Foundation

// MARK: - Introduction to Advanced Operators

// In addition to the operators described in Basic Operators, Swift provides several advanced
// operators that perform more complex value manipulation. These include all of the bitwise and
// bit shifting operators you will be familiar with from C and Objective-C.

// Unlike arithmetic operators in C, arithmetic operators in Swift don't overflow by default.
// Overflow behavior is trapped and reported as an error. To opt in to overflow behavior, use
// Swift's second set of arithmetic operators that overflow by default, such as the overflow
// addition operator (&+). All of these overflow operators begin with an ampersand (&).

// When you define your own structures, classes, and enumerations, it can be useful to provide
// your own implementations of the standard Swift operators for these custom types. Swift makes
// it easy to provide tailored implementations of these operators and to determine exactly what
// their behavior should be for each type you create.

// You're not limited to the predefined operators. Swift gives you the freedom to define your own
// custom infix, prefix, postfix, and assignment operators, with custom precedence and associativity
// values. These operators can be used and adopted in your code like any of the predefined operators,
// and you can even extend existing types to support the custom operators you define.

// MARK: - Bitwise Operators

// Bitwise operators enable you to manipulate the individual raw data bits within a data structure.
// They're often used in low-level programming, such as graphics programming and device driver
// creation. Bitwise operators can also be useful when you work with raw data from external sources,
// such as encoding and decoding data for communication over a custom protocol.

// Swift supports all of the bitwise operators found in C, as described below.

// MARK: - Bitwise NOT Operator

// The bitwise NOT operator (~) inverts all bits in a number:

// The bitwise NOT operator is a prefix operator, and appears immediately before the value it
// operates on, without any white space

let initialBits: UInt8 = 0b00001111
let invertedBits = ~initialBits  // equals 11110000

// UInt8 integers have eight bits and can store any value between 0 and 255. This example
// initializes a UInt8 integer with the binary value 00001111, which has its first four bits set
// to 0, and its second four bits set to 1. This is equivalent to a decimal value of 15.

// The bitwise NOT operator is then used to create a new constant called invertedBits, which is
// equal to initialBits, but with all of the bits inverted. Zeros become ones, and ones become
// zeros. The value of invertedBits is 11110000, which is equal to an unsigned decimal value of 240.

print("Initial bits: \(initialBits) (binary: \(String(initialBits, radix: 2)))")
print("Inverted bits: \(invertedBits) (binary: \(String(invertedBits, radix: 2)))")

// MARK: - Bitwise AND Operator

// The bitwise AND operator (&) combines the bits of two numbers. It returns a new number whose
// bits are set to 1 only if the bits were equal to 1 in both input numbers:

// In the example below, the values of firstSixBits and lastSixBits both have four middle bits
// equal to 1. The bitwise AND operator combines them to make the number 00111100, which is equal
// to an unsigned decimal value of 60

let firstSixBits: UInt8 = 0b11111100
let lastSixBits: UInt8  = 0b00111111
let middleFourBits = firstSixBits & lastSixBits  // equals 00111100

print("First six bits: \(firstSixBits)")
print("Last six bits: \(lastSixBits)")
print("Middle four bits: \(middleFourBits)")

// MARK: - Bitwise OR Operator

// The bitwise OR operator (|) compares the bits of two numbers. The operator returns a new number
// whose bits are set to 1 if the bits are equal to 1 in either input number:

// In the example below, the values of someBits and moreBits have different bits set to 1. The
// bitwise OR operator combines them to make the number 11111110, which equals an unsigned decimal
// of 254

let someBits: UInt8 = 0b10110010
let moreBits: UInt8 = 0b01011110
let combinedbits = someBits | moreBits  // equals 11111110

print("Some bits: \(someBits)")
print("More bits: \(moreBits)")
print("Combined bits: \(combinedbits)")

// MARK: - Bitwise XOR Operator

// The bitwise XOR operator, or "exclusive OR operator" (^), compares the bits of two numbers. The
// operator returns a new number whose bits are set to 1 where the input bits are different and
// are set to 0 where the input bits are the same:

// In the example below, the values of firstBits and otherBits each have a bit set to 1 in a
// location that the other does not. The bitwise XOR operator sets both of these bits to 1 in its
// output value. All of the other bits in firstBits and otherBits match and are set to 0 in the
// output value

let firstBits: UInt8 = 0b00010100
let otherBits: UInt8 = 0b00000101
let outputBits = firstBits ^ otherBits  // equals 00010001

print("First bits: \(firstBits)")
print("Other bits: \(otherBits)")
print("Output bits: \(outputBits)")

// MARK: - Bitwise Left and Right Shift Operators

// The bitwise left shift operator (<<) and bitwise right shift operator (>>) move all bits in a
// number to the left or the right by a certain number of places, according to the rules defined
// below.

// Bitwise left and right shifts have the effect of multiplying or dividing an integer by a factor
// of two. Shifting an integer's bits to the left by one position doubles its value, whereas
// shifting it to the right by one position halves its value.

// MARK: - Shifting Behavior for Unsigned Integers

// The bit-shifting behavior for unsigned integers is as follows:
// - Existing bits are moved to the left or right by the requested number of places.
// - Any bits that are moved beyond the bounds of the integer's storage are discarded.
// - Zeros are inserted in the spaces left behind after the original bits are moved to the left
//   or right.

// This approach is known as a logical shift.

// Here's how bit shifting looks in Swift code

let shiftBits: UInt8 = 4   // 00000100 in binary
print("Original: \(shiftBits)")
print("Left shift 1: \(shiftBits << 1)")  // 00001000
print("Left shift 2: \(shiftBits << 2)")  // 00010000
print("Left shift 5: \(shiftBits << 5)")  // 10000000
print("Left shift 6: \(shiftBits << 6)")  // 00000000
print("Right shift 2: \(shiftBits >> 2)")  // 00000001

// You can use bit shifting to encode and decode values within other data types

let pink: UInt32 = 0xCC6699
let redComponent = (pink & 0xFF0000) >> 16    // redComponent is 0xCC, or 204
let greenComponent = (pink & 0x00FF00) >> 8   // greenComponent is 0x66, or 102
let blueComponent = pink & 0x0000FF           // blueComponent is 0x99, or 153

print("Pink color: #\(String(pink, radix: 16).uppercased())")
print("Red: \(redComponent), Green: \(greenComponent), Blue: \(blueComponent)")

// This example uses a UInt32 constant called pink to store a Cascading Style Sheets color value
// for the color pink. The CSS color value #CC6699 is written as 0xCC6699 in Swift's hexadecimal
// number representation. This color is then decomposed into its red (CC), green (66), and blue
// (99) components by the bitwise AND operator (&) and the bitwise right shift operator (>>).

// MARK: - Shifting Behavior for Signed Integers

// The shifting behavior is more complex for signed integers than for unsigned integers, because
// of the way signed integers are represented in binary. (The examples below are based on 8-bit
// signed integers for simplicity, but the same principles apply for signed integers of any size.)

// Signed integers use their first bit (known as the sign bit) to indicate whether the integer is
// positive or negative. A sign bit of 0 means positive, and a sign bit of 1 means negative.

// The remaining bits (known as the value bits) store the actual value. Positive numbers are stored
// in exactly the same way as for unsigned integers, counting upwards from 0.

// Negative numbers, however, are stored differently. They're stored by subtracting their absolute
// value from 2 to the power of n, where n is the number of value bits. An eight-bit number has
// seven value bits, so this means 2 to the power of 7, or 128.

// This encoding for negative numbers is known as a two's complement representation. It may seem an
// unusual way to represent negative numbers, but it has several advantages.

// When you shift signed integers to the right, apply the same rules as for unsigned integers,
// but fill any empty bits on the left with the sign bit, rather than with a zero. This action
// ensures that signed integers have the same sign after they're shifted to the right, and is
// known as an arithmetic shift.

let signedBits: Int8 = -4
print("Signed bits: \(signedBits)")
print("Right shift 1: \(signedBits >> 1)")  // -2 (arithmetic shift preserves sign)

// MARK: - Overflow Operators

// If you try to insert a number into an integer constant or variable that can't hold that value,
// by default Swift reports an error rather than allowing an invalid value to be created. This
// behavior gives extra safety when you work with numbers that are too large or too small.

// For example, the Int16 integer type can hold any signed integer between -32768 and 32767.
// Trying to set an Int16 constant or variable to a number outside of this range causes an error

var potentialOverflow = Int16.max
// potentialOverflow equals 32767, which is the maximum value an Int16 can hold
// potentialOverflow += 1
// this causes an error

// However, when you specifically want an overflow condition to truncate the number of available
// bits, you can opt in to this behavior rather than triggering an error. Swift provides three
// arithmetic overflow operators that opt in to the overflow behavior for integer calculations.
// These operators all begin with an ampersand (&):
// - Overflow addition (&+)
// - Overflow subtraction (&-)
// - Overflow multiplication (&*)

// MARK: - Value Overflow

// Numbers can overflow in both the positive and negative direction.

// Here's an example of what happens when an unsigned integer is allowed to overflow in the
// positive direction, using the overflow addition operator (&+)

var unsignedOverflow = UInt8.max
// unsignedOverflow equals 255, which is the maximum value a UInt8 can hold
unsignedOverflow = unsignedOverflow &+ 1
// unsignedOverflow is now equal to 0

print("UInt8 max: \(UInt8.max)")
print("After overflow addition: \(unsignedOverflow)")

// Something similar happens when an unsigned integer is allowed to overflow in the negative
// direction. Here's an example using the overflow subtraction operator (&-)

var unsignedOverflow2 = UInt8.min
// unsignedOverflow2 equals 0, which is the minimum value a UInt8 can hold
unsignedOverflow2 = unsignedOverflow2 &- 1
// unsignedOverflow2 is now equal to 255

print("UInt8 min: \(UInt8.min)")
print("After overflow subtraction: \(unsignedOverflow2)")

// Overflow also occurs for signed integers. All addition and subtraction for signed integers is
// performed in bitwise fashion, with the sign bit included as part of the numbers being added or
// subtracted, as described in Bitwise Left and Right Shift Operators

var signedOverflow = Int8.min
// signedOverflow equals -128, which is the minimum value an Int8 can hold
signedOverflow = signedOverflow &- 1
// signedOverflow is now equal to 127

print("Int8 min: \(Int8.min)")
print("After overflow subtraction: \(signedOverflow)")

// The minimum value that an Int8 can hold is -128, or 10000000 in binary. Subtracting 1 from
// this binary number with the overflow operator gives a binary value of 01111111, which toggles
// the sign bit and gives positive 127, the maximum positive value that an Int8 can hold.

// For both signed and unsigned integers, overflow in the positive direction wraps around from the
// maximum valid integer value back to the minimum, and overflow in the negative direction wraps
// around from the minimum value to the maximum.

// MARK: - Precedence and Associativity

// Operator precedence gives some operators higher priority than others; these operators are
// applied first.

// Operator associativity defines how operators of the same precedence are grouped together —
// either grouped from the left, or grouped from the right. Think of it as meaning "they associate
// with the expression to their left," or "they associate with the expression to their right."

// It's important to consider each operator's precedence and associativity when working out the
// order in which a compound expression will be calculated. For example, operator precedence
// explains why the following expression equals 17

let result = 2 + 3 % 4 * 5
// this equals 17

print("2 + 3 % 4 * 5 = \(result)")

// If you read strictly from left to right, you might expect the expression to be calculated as:
// - 2 plus 3 equals 5
// - 5 remainder 4 equals 1
// - 1 times 5 equals 5

// However, the actual answer is 17, not 5. Higher-precedence operators are evaluated before
// lower-precedence ones. In Swift, as in C, the remainder operator (%) and the multiplication
// operator (*) have a higher precedence than the addition operator (+). As a result, they're both
// evaluated before the addition is considered.

// However, remainder and multiplication have the same precedence as each other. To work out the
// exact evaluation order to use, you also need to consider their associativity. Remainder and
// multiplication both associate with the expression to their left. Think of this as adding
// implicit parentheses around these parts of the expression, starting from their left:

// 2 + ((3 % 4) * 5)
// (3 % 4) is 3, so this is equivalent to:
// 2 + (3 * 5)
// (3 * 5) is 15, so this is equivalent to:
// 2 + 15
// This calculation yields the final answer of 17.

// MARK: - Operator Methods

// Classes and structures can provide their own implementations of existing operators. This is
// known as overloading the existing operators.

// The example below shows how to implement the arithmetic addition operator (+) for a custom
// structure. The arithmetic addition operator is a binary operator because it operates on two
// targets and it's an infix operator because it appears between those two targets.

// The example defines a Vector2D structure for a two-dimensional position vector (x, y), followed
// by a definition of an operator method to add together instances of the Vector2D structure

struct Vector2D {
    var x = 0.0, y = 0.0
}

extension Vector2D {
    static func + (left: Vector2D, right: Vector2D) -> Vector2D {
        return Vector2D(x: left.x + right.x, y: left.y + right.y)
    }
}

// The operator method is defined as a type method on Vector2D, with a method name that matches
// the operator to be overloaded (+). Because addition isn't part of the essential behavior for a
// vector, the type method is defined in an extension of Vector2D rather than in the main structure
// declaration of Vector2D. Because the arithmetic addition operator is a binary operator, this
// operator method takes two input parameters of type Vector2D and returns a single output value,
// also of type Vector2D.

// In this implementation, the input parameters are named left and right to represent the Vector2D
// instances that will be on the left side and right side of the + operator. The method returns a
// new Vector2D instance, whose x and y properties are initialized with the sum of the x and y
// properties from the two Vector2D instances that are added together.

// The type method can be used as an infix operator between existing Vector2D instances

let vector = Vector2D(x: 3.0, y: 1.0)
let anotherVector = Vector2D(x: 2.0, y: 4.0)
let combinedVector = vector + anotherVector
// combinedVector is a Vector2D instance with values of (5.0, 5.0)

print("Vector: (\(vector.x), \(vector.y))")
print("Another vector: (\(anotherVector.x), \(anotherVector.y))")
print("Combined: (\(combinedVector.x), \(combinedVector.y))")

// MARK: - Prefix and Postfix Operators

// The example shown above demonstrates a custom implementation of a binary infix operator. Classes
// and structures can also provide implementations of the standard unary operators. Unary operators
// operate on a single target. They're prefix if they precede their target (such as -a) and postfix
// operators if they follow their target (such as b!).

// You implement a prefix or postfix unary operator by writing the prefix or postfix modifier before
// the func keyword when declaring the operator method

extension Vector2D {
    static prefix func - (vector: Vector2D) -> Vector2D {
        return Vector2D(x: -vector.x, y: -vector.y)
    }
}

// The example above implements the unary minus operator (-a) for Vector2D instances. The unary
// minus operator is a prefix operator, and so this method has to be qualified with the prefix
// modifier.

// For simple numeric values, the unary minus operator converts positive numbers into their negative
// equivalent and vice versa. The corresponding implementation for Vector2D instances performs this
// operation on both the x and y properties

let positive = Vector2D(x: 3.0, y: 4.0)
let negative = -positive
// negative is a Vector2D instance with values of (-3.0, -4.0)
let alsoPositive = -negative
// alsoPositive is a Vector2D instance with values of (3.0, 4.0)

print("Positive: (\(positive.x), \(positive.y))")
print("Negative: (\(negative.x), \(negative.y))")
print("Also positive: (\(alsoPositive.x), \(alsoPositive.y))")

// MARK: - Compound Assignment Operators

// Compound assignment operators combine assignment (=) with another operation. For example, the
// addition assignment operator (+=) combines addition and assignment into a single operation.
// You mark a compound assignment operator's left input parameter type as inout, because the
// parameter's value will be modified directly from within the operator method.

// The example below implements an addition assignment operator method for Vector2D instances

extension Vector2D {
    static func += (left: inout Vector2D, right: Vector2D) {
        left = left + right
    }
}

// Because an addition operator was defined earlier, you don't need to reimplement the addition
// process here. Instead, the addition assignment operator method takes advantage of the existing
// addition operator method, and uses it to set the left value to be the left value plus the right
// value

var original = Vector2D(x: 1.0, y: 2.0)
let vectorToAdd = Vector2D(x: 3.0, y: 4.0)
original += vectorToAdd
// original now has values of (4.0, 6.0)

print("Original after +=: (\(original.x), \(original.y))")

// Note: It isn't possible to overload the default assignment operator (=). Only the compound
// assignment operators can be overloaded. Similarly, the ternary conditional operator (a ? b : c)
// can't be overloaded.

// MARK: - Equivalence Operators

// By default, custom classes and structures don't have an implementation of the equivalence
// operators, known as the equal to operator (==) and not equal to operator (!=). You usually
// implement the == operator, and use the Swift standard library's default implementation of the
// != operator that negates the result of the == operator. There are two ways to implement the ==
// operator: You can implement it yourself, or for many types, you can ask Swift to synthesize an
// implementation for you. In both cases, you add conformance to the Swift standard library's
// Equatable protocol.

// You provide an implementation of the == operator in the same way as you implement other infix
// operators

extension Vector2D: Equatable {
    static func == (left: Vector2D, right: Vector2D) -> Bool {
        return (left.x == right.x) && (left.y == right.y)
    }
}

// The example above implements an == operator to check whether two Vector2D instances have
// equivalent values. In the context of Vector2D, it makes sense to consider "equal" as meaning
// "both instances have the same x values and y values", and so this is the logic used by the
// operator implementation.

// You can now use this operator to check whether two Vector2D instances are equivalent

let twoThree = Vector2D(x: 2.0, y: 3.0)
let anotherTwoThree = Vector2D(x: 2.0, y: 3.0)
if twoThree == anotherTwoThree {
    print("These two vectors are equivalent.")
}
// Prints "These two vectors are equivalent."

// In many simple cases, you can ask Swift to provide synthesized implementations of the equivalence
// operators for you, as described in Adopting a Protocol Using a Synthesized Implementation.

// MARK: - Custom Operators

// You can declare and implement your own custom operators in addition to the standard operators
// provided by Swift. For a list of characters that can be used to define custom operators, see
// Operators.

// New operators are declared at a global level using the operator keyword, and are marked with the
// prefix, infix or postfix modifiers

prefix operator +++

// The example above defines a new prefix operator called +++. This operator doesn't have an
// existing meaning in Swift, and so it's given its own custom meaning below in the specific
// context of working with Vector2D instances. For the purposes of this example, +++ is treated as
// a new "prefix doubling" operator. It doubles the x and y values of a Vector2D instance, by
// adding the vector to itself with the addition assignment operator defined earlier. To implement
// the +++ operator, you add a type method called +++ to Vector2D as follows

extension Vector2D {
    static prefix func +++ (vector: inout Vector2D) -> Vector2D {
        vector += vector
        return vector
    }
}

var toBeDoubled = Vector2D(x: 1.0, y: 4.0)
let afterDoubling = +++toBeDoubled
// toBeDoubled now has values of (2.0, 8.0)
// afterDoubling also has values of (2.0, 8.0)

print("Before doubling: (\(toBeDoubled.x), \(toBeDoubled.y))")
print("After doubling: (\(afterDoubling.x), \(afterDoubling.y))")

// MARK: - Precedence for Custom Infix Operators

// Custom infix operators each belong to a precedence group. A precedence group specifies an
// operator's precedence relative to other infix operators, as well as the operator's associativity.
// See Precedence and Associativity for an explanation of how these characteristics affect an infix
// operator's interaction with other infix operators.

// A custom infix operator that isn't explicitly placed into a precedence group is given a default
// precedence group with a precedence immediately higher than the precedence of the ternary
// conditional operator.

// The following example defines a new custom infix operator called +-, which belongs to the
// precedence group AdditionPrecedence

infix operator +-: AdditionPrecedence

extension Vector2D {
    static func +- (left: Vector2D, right: Vector2D) -> Vector2D {
        return Vector2D(x: left.x + right.x, y: left.y - right.y)
    }
}

let firstVector = Vector2D(x: 1.0, y: 2.0)
let secondVector = Vector2D(x: 3.0, y: 4.0)
let plusMinusVector = firstVector +- secondVector
// plusMinusVector is a Vector2D instance with values of (4.0, -2.0)

print("First: (\(firstVector.x), \(firstVector.y))")
print("Second: (\(secondVector.x), \(secondVector.y))")
print("Plus-minus: (\(plusMinusVector.x), \(plusMinusVector.y))")

// This operator adds together the x values of two vectors, and subtracts the y value of the second
// vector from the first. Because it's in essence an "additive" operator, it has been given the
// same precedence group as additive infix operators such as + and -.

// Note: You don't specify a precedence when defining a prefix or postfix operator. However, if
// you apply both a prefix and a postfix operator to the same operand, the postfix operator is
// applied first.

// MARK: - Result Builders

// A result builder is a type you define that adds syntax for creating nested data, like a list or
// tree, in a natural, declarative way. The code that uses the result builder can include
// ordinary Swift syntax, like if and for, to handle conditional or repeated pieces of data.

// The code below defines a few types for drawing on a single line using stars and text

protocol Drawable {
    func draw() -> String
}

struct Line: Drawable {
    var elements: [Drawable]
    func draw() -> String {
        return elements.map { $0.draw() }.joined(separator: "")
    }
}

struct Text: Drawable {
    var content: String
    init(_ content: String) { self.content = content }
    func draw() -> String { return content }
}

struct Space: Drawable {
    func draw() -> String { return " " }
}

struct Stars: Drawable {
    var length: Int
    func draw() -> String { return String(repeating: "*", count: length) }
}

struct AllCaps: Drawable {
    var content: Drawable
    func draw() -> String { return content.draw().uppercased() }
}

// The Drawable protocol defines the requirement for something that can be drawn, like a line or
// shape: The type must implement a draw() method. The Line structure represents a single-line
// drawing, and it serves the top-level container for most drawings. To draw a Line, the structure
// calls draw() on each of the line's components, and then concatenates the resulting strings into
// a single string. The Text structure wraps a string to make it part of a drawing. The AllCaps
// structure wraps and modifies another drawing, converting any text in the drawing to uppercase.

// It's possible to make a drawing with these types by calling their initializers

let name: String? = "Ravi Patel"
let manualDrawing = Line(elements: [
    Stars(length: 3),
    Text("Hello"),
    Space(),
    AllCaps(content: Text((name ?? "World") + "!")),
    Stars(length: 2),
])
print(manualDrawing.draw())
// Prints "***Hello RAVI PATEL!**"

// This code works, but it's a little awkward. The deeply nested parentheses after AllCaps are
// hard to read. The fallback logic to use "World" when name is nil has to be done inline using
// the ?? operator, which would be difficult with anything more complex. If you needed to include
// switches or for loops to build up part of the drawing, there's no way to do that. A result
// builder lets you rewrite code like this so that it looks like normal Swift code.

// To define a result builder, you write the @resultBuilder attribute on a type declaration. For
// example, this code defines a result builder called DrawingBuilder, which lets you use a
// declarative syntax to describe a drawing

@resultBuilder
struct DrawingBuilder {
    static func buildBlock(_ components: Drawable...) -> Drawable {
        return Line(elements: components)
    }
    
    static func buildEither(first: Drawable) -> Drawable {
        return first
    }
    
    static func buildEither(second: Drawable) -> Drawable {
        return second
    }
}

// The DrawingBuilder structure defines three methods that implement parts of the result builder
// syntax. The buildBlock(_:) method adds support for writing a series of lines in a block of code.
// It combines the components in that block into a Line. The buildEither(first:) and
// buildEither(second:) methods add support for if-else.

// You can apply the @DrawingBuilder attribute to a function's parameter, which turns a closure
// passed to the function into the value that the result builder creates from that closure. For
// example

func draw(@DrawingBuilder content: () -> Drawable) -> Drawable {
    return content()
}

func caps(@DrawingBuilder content: () -> Drawable) -> Drawable {
    return AllCaps(content: content())
}

func makeGreeting(for name: String? = nil) -> Drawable {
    let greeting = draw {
        Stars(length: 3)
        Text("Hello")
        Space()
        caps {
            if let name = name {
                Text(name + "!")
            } else {
                Text("World!")
            }
        }
        Stars(length: 2)
    }
    return greeting
}

let genericGreeting = makeGreeting()
print(genericGreeting.draw())
// Prints "***Hello WORLD!**"

let personalGreeting = makeGreeting(for: "Ravi Patel")
print(personalGreeting.draw())
// Prints "***Hello RAVI PATEL!**"

// The makeGreeting(for:) function takes a name parameter and uses it to draw a personalized
// greeting. The draw(_:) and caps(_:) functions both take a single closure as their argument,
// which is marked with the @DrawingBuilder attribute. When you call those functions, you use the
// special syntax that DrawingBuilder defines. Swift transforms that declarative description of a
// drawing into a series of calls to the methods on DrawingBuilder to build up the value that's
// passed as the function argument.

// To add support for writing for loops in the special drawing syntax, add a buildArray(_:) method

extension DrawingBuilder {
